> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's highly recommended **not** to `#include` both `DelibWlan.h` and `DelibEthernet.h` modules at once, since the first one compiles for Generic ESP8266 Controller and the second one for Arduino Uno with Ethernet interface installed.

> Modules potentially can work together if some controller has both interfaces to communicate with WLAN and Ethernet (like based on ESP32 WT32-ETH01 controller), but I didn't test it and most likely won't to.

## 🐈Summary
Core network lib for mirco contollers to initialize and handle their server side.

## 🐈Pre-requirements
1. Get **[ESP8266 Community](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)** board extenstion if you plan to work with WLAN module. `DelibWlan.h` designed for esp8266 controller;
2. Copy dependencies from **[add-ons](https://github.com/de-things/delib/tree/main/add-ons)** to the local arduino libraries directory.
3. Delib relies on `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`, so make sure your logs screen supports it.

## 🐈Install
Clone repo into the local arduino librares folder. For Windows it should be:

```
~\Documents\Arduino\libraries\
```

## 🐈WiFi Example
```
todo:
  scheme
  code
```

## 🐈Ethernet Example
