This folder contains `delib` dependencies for a purpose if something won't work with latest versions of these libs downloaded from original sources.

Install libs into local libraries folder. For Windows it should be:

```
~\Documents\Arduino\libraries\
    - delib
    - Ethernet
    - LiquidCrystal_I2C
    - ...
```
